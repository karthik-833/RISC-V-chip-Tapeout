# RISC-V-chip-Tapeout
This repository documents my end-to-end RISC-V project, covering the complete flow from RTL design and verification to physical design and tapeout. It showcases the use of open-source EDA tools, the SkyWater 130nm PDK, and industry-standard VLSI methodologies, with step-by-step progress, code, and results maintained for learning and reference.
