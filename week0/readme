Week-0 Video Summary (RISC-V Tapeout Program) 

SoC Development Flow
Specification (C Model) → Write system requirements in C, validate with C testbench.
RTL Design → Convert to Verilog/VHDL; include processor core + peripherals.
Synthesis → RTL → gate-level netlist; generate macros; use analog IPs.
SoC Integration → Combine CPU, peripherals, macros, analog IPs; verify via buses/GPIOs.
Back-End (RTL → GDS) → Floorplan, placement, clock tree, routing; add hard/soft macros.
Final Steps → DRC/LVS checks; generate GDSII → tapeout.

Microcontroller
Small SoC with processor + peripherals.
Operates at 100–130 MHz, programmed/tested in C.
Applications: Wearables (iWatch), Arduino boards, TV panels, AC/home appliances.
